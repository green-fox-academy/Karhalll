                <h3>Insturction set</h2>
                <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean 
                    function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or 
                    more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>
                
                <h3>ASCII Code</h2>
                <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 
                    Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical 
                    representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of 
                    some sort.</p>

                <h3>Random-access memory (RAM)</h2>
                <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently 
                    used program instructions to increase the general speed of a 
                    system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or 
                    written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the 
                    physical location of data inside the memory.</p>

                <h3>Programming language</h2>
                <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can 
                    be used to produce various kinds of output. They generally consist 
                    of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs 
                    that implement specific algorithms.</p>

                <h3>Domain Name System (DNS)</h2>
                <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, 
                    or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. 
                    It associates various information with domain names assigned to 
                    each of the participating entities.</p>

                <h3>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h2>
                <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia 
                    information systems. It is the foundation of data communication for 
                    the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer 
                    hypertext.</p>
